# Cipher Crypt
CipherCrypt is a text encryption and decryption application built using Java. It features secure encryption, key validation, and robust decryption functionality for protecting text-based information. Only users with the correct key can decrypt the encrypted text.
# Features
- Text Encryption: Converts plaintext into a secure, encoded format using key-based transformations.
 
- Text Decryption: Decodes encrypted text back to its original format with the correct key.

- Key Validation: Ensures only authorized users with the correct key can decrypt the text.

- Recursive Processing: Implements recursive algorithms for transformations and divide-and-conquer techniques.

- Sorting for Encryption: Uses bubble sort to add an additional layer of complexity to the encryption process.

- Bit Manipulation: Employs XOR operations for secure data transformations.

# Usage
  1. Run the application.
  
  2. Input the text you want to encrypt.
  
  3. Provide a key for encryption.
 
  4. To decrypt:
      - Provide the correct key.
      - There are only 3 attempts to decrypt the file.
      - If the correct key is not provided within these attempts, the decryption will fail, and the application will lock further attempts.

# Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java

+ Core Concepts: Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Bit Manipulation, Bubble Sort and Divide-and-Conquer
