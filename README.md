# Cipher_Crypt
CipherCrypt is a text encryption and decryption application built using Java. It features secure encryption, key validation, and robust decryption functionality for protecting text-based information. Only users with the correct key can decrypt the encrypted text.
# Features

. Text Encryption: Converts plaintext into a secure, encoded format using key-based transformations.

Text Decryption: Decodes encrypted text back to its original format with the correct key.

Key Validation: Ensures only authorized users with the correct key can decrypt the text.

Recursive Processing: Implements recursive algorithms for transformations and divide-and-conquer techniques.

Sorting for Encryption: Uses bubble sort to add an additional layer of complexity to the encryption process.

Bit Manipulation: Employs XOR operations for secure data transformations.
